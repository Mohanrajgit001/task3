# Linear Regression (Housing Prices)

## ðŸ“– Description
This project implements **linear regression** models to predict housing prices from the provided dataset (`housing.csv`).  
Steps include data cleaning, preprocessing, feature selection, model training, diagnostics, and evaluation.

We explore:
- Multiple Linear Regression (baseline)
- Log-transform of target
- Regularization (Ridge and Lasso)
- Cross-validation for model robustness

Diagnostic plots and coefficient analysis are provided.
